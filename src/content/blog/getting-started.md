Welcome to VocaSync! This is a short demo post to show you how easy it is to add audio narration to your Astro blog.

## What is VocaSync?

VocaSync turns your written content into narrated audio with word-level synchronization. As listeners play the audio, each word highlights in real-time, creating a karaoke-style reading experience.

## Key Features

The integration offers several powerful features out of the box:

- **Natural voices** powered by advanced text-to-speech
- **Word highlighting** that follows along with playback
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for accessible navigation
- **Mini player** that sticks when scrolling
- **57 languages** supported for global reach

## Try It Out

Press the play button above to hear this post narrated. Watch as each word highlights in sync with the audio. You can adjust the speed, toggle highlighting on or off, and use keyboard shortcuts like Space to play or pause.

That's all for this quick intro. Check out the longer post for a deeper dive into the technology behind VocaSync!
